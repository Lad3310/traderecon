OVERVIEW
Interactive Messaging for Real-Time Comparison
This document provides Members of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation‘s (“FICC”) Government Securities
Division (“GSD”) with interactive messaging input and output specifications for real-time trade comparison
messages used to support GSD’s products and services.
Audience
This document was written for systems and development personnel including managers, analysts and
programmers of GSD Member firms. It presumes readers are familiar with technical concepts and terms as
well as having a basic understanding of GSD's products and services.
Related Materials
The specifications for interactive messages supporting trade comparison are based on SWIFT messages.
Users of this document are therefore strongly urged to ref er to SWIFT user documentation to obtain a complete
and comprehensive understanding of these message standards. SWIFT inf ormation (including message
f ormats) can be found at www.iso15022.org
. The specifications of interactive messaging for GSD’s netting
output used to support GSD products and services can be found in the latest version of the “GSD Interactive
Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Netting Output” document.

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Introduction 7
INTRODUCTION
This document provides the real-time comparison specifications for Interactive Messaging related to the
support of GSD’s products and services, enabling GSD Members to receive trade status messages on an
interactive/intra-day basis using standardized SWIFT formats.
Members have the ability to submit trade input to GSD intra-day, as trades are executed, using the SWIFT
MT515 message format. Submitters can immediately receive trade status information (e.g. notification of
whether the trade has been accepted or rejected) via the SWIFT MT509 message format. This format is also
used to provide up-to-the-minute trade status information to Members as transactions are processed by GSD
(f or example, a message is sent when a trade compares, is canceled or is modified).
Trade counterparties can also be notified immediately via a SWIFT MT518 message when a trade has been
submitted against them. The SWIFT MT518 message contains full trade details and is similar to the MT515. It
is also used to communicate to the Member those changes that GSD may have made to trade records that
were previously submitted.
Messages discussed in this document will give Members the ability to take in important trade status information
on a real-time basis.
It should be noted that this document is a technical specification and is not, in any way, intended to
communicate legal definitions as to when trades are guaranteed or novated by GSD. Members should refer to
the FICC GSD Rulebook for such information.
For additional service details, please refer to the Clearing Services > Fixed Income – GSD section available at
www.dtcc.com
.
Note:
GSD utilizes SWIFT standardized messages, but it does not utilize the SWIFT network. GSD currently utilizes its
proprietary network for communication between GSD and its Members. The SWIFT outbound and inbound messaging
format GSD employs is meant to be compliant with SWIFT standards so that the SWIFT network could be used in the
future. GSD utilizes the flexible ISO 15022 message formats for its outbound and inbound real-time messaging. Such
flexibility allows GSD to deploy new coding for these formats as new functionalities or services are added.

COMPARISON INTERACTIVE MESSAGE OVERVIEW
Message Overview
The Interactive Messaging (supporting trade input and trade status output) that is outlined in this document are
message types:
• MT515 – The MT515 (Trade Input) message is used by GSD Members to submit trades to GSD, enter
trade cancellations, modify Member reference numbers on previously submitted trades and to submit DK
notif ications on trades, as applicable, submitted against them.
o GSD uses three styles of this message:
» DVP – This f ormat is used by Members using the DVP system
» GCF – This f ormat is used by Members using the GCF system
» CCIT – This f ormat is used by CCIT Members using the GCF system
• MT509 – The MT509 Trade Status Message is used by GSD to communicate the status of each input
(submission, modification, cancellation or DK) message that has been submitted to GSD for processing by
a GSD Member or a GSD Member’s service bureau.
• MT518 – The MT518 Message is used by GSD to communicate to GSD Members that a trade input
(submission, modification, cancellation or DK) message has been submitted for a transaction for which
they are a party to.
• MT599 – The MT599 Message is used by GSD to communicate to GSD Members system administrative
inf ormation such as system availability and major system events to Members.
The upcoming sections will contain message formatting information and the detailed specifications for the
MT515, MT509, MT518 and MT599 Messages.
Message Formatting Structure
This document presents specifications for the SWIFT Message Types mentioned above. Three of the message
types (MT515, MT509 and MT518) utilize ISO 15022 Formats. The fourth message type (MT599) is a Free
Format Message. A basic overview of the ISO 15022 Message Structure can be found below.
Formatting Structure Overview
This section of the document provides some background information that may be useful for interpreting the
detailed message specifications that follow. Much of the information that appears in this section of the
document has been derived from the “SWIFT Standards Category 5 Securities Market Message Usage
Guidelines - September, 2000 Edition.”
ISO 15022 SWIFT message formats are constructed using a modular methodology based on the premise that
inf ormation can be identified and programmed once, then reused wherever needed. Using this approach, data
is configured into logical groups (e.g., generic fields and blocks) according to business purpose. These groups
are then uniquely identified (using tags, qualifiers and start/end of block designators) so that they can be used

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Overview 9
whenever needed to fulfill particular business purposes across a number of messages without requiring
extensive reprogramming.
If the basic message structure were diagramed from the top down (going from the more general to the more
specific), you would have a Message Header followed by one or more information blocks (potentially containing
sub-blocks), composed of one or more fields. Each of these components is defined below.
Note:
While GSD has elected to use SWIFT standardized messages, it is not utilizing the SWIFT network. GSD utilizes its
proprietary network for communication between GSD and its members. The messages are intended, however, to be
compliant with SWIFT standards.
Message Header
The message header specifies the sending and receiving parties of the message and provides the message
type. The message header is the first component of every message and are in a f ixed format. The header is
populated as a continuous string of data (complying with the requirement specifying the allowable characters
f or a given line in a message) and terminates as a regular data field (with a carriage return line feed “CRLF”).
Within the header is a “Password” f ield, which is a unique identifier provided by GSD for each Member to input
on their MT515 messages sent to GSD. For all GSD outbound comparison messages (MT509, MT518 and
MT599), the password field will be blank-filled.
Message Header Format
The Message Type Field contained in the message header defines the purpose of the message. As Indicated
previously, this message header will be utilized on all GSD comparison interactive messages: MT515, MT509,
MT518 and MT599.
M/O Tag Block/Qualifier Sub-qualifier/Options Field Description Data Format
Message Header
M Password 12!c
M Sender 8!c
M Message Type 3!n/3!n/4!c
M Receiver 8!c
Blocks/Qualifiers
A block or qualifier may be defined as a group of fields containing related business information that is framed
by Start of Block and End of Block designators. The use of a block is not restricted to any given message. It
can be reused across a number of messages and combined with other blocks to fulfill a variety of business
purposes. For example, the General Information (GENL) block found in the MT515, MT509 and MT518
messages in this document, contain general information regarding the trade, such as trade reference numbers.
The Conf irmation Details (CONFDET) block found in the MT515 and MT518, contains specific trade

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Overview 10
inf ormation such as trade date, settlement date, price, security and information regarding the confirming
parties.
Each message contains one or more blocks. A typical message contains a General Inf ormation (GENL) block,
f ollowed by a series of detail blocks. These blocks may be mandatory or optional within a particular message,
and are structured as follows:
• A Start of Block designator (represented by the tag 16R), indicating the start of a group of related
inf ormation
• One or more sub-qualifiers and/or fields
• An End of Block designator (represented by the tag 16S), indicating the end of a group of related
inf ormation.
Data Fields
There are two types of ISO15022 data fields: generic fields and discrete fields. A generic field is used to
express the data of a f amily or business class of data items of the same nature, for example, dates, amounts.
Note: A generic data field tag uses a qualifier to specify the precise meaning of each business element of the
business class. A discrete field is used to express a specific single business data item. Note: A discrete data
f ield tag does not need a qualifier to further define the meaning of the data.
At a minimum, each field is composed of an identifying tag and its associated field data. For example, 98A is
the generic tag used to indicate a date/time field in a particular format (YYYYMMDD).
1 
The f ormat for a tag
includes two delimiters – one to indicate the start of the tag, and a second to indicate the end of the tag. These
delimiters are indicated using a colon. Continuing with 98A tag as an example, the proper format for the
generic tag used to indicate a date in the YYYYMMDD format would be “:98A:”.
Because there are a number of different types of dates that may be associated with any given trade, the
generic f ield tag must be further described if it is to be useful. Qualifiers are used to provide this additional level
of description. For example, the tag 98A followed by the qualifier SETT means that the corresponding field data
is the settlement date (Start Leg Settlement Date if the record is for a Repo Transaction) for the trade. The tag
98A f ollowed by the qualifier TRAD means the corresponding field data is the trade date and time for the trade.
Qualif iers for generic tags are always preceded by an additional colon “:”.
The generic f ield for a settlement date of September 28, 2020 in the YYYYMMDD format, including the generic
tag, the qualifier and the field data would be “:98A::SETT//20200928”. Tags that are part of a block must
remain within the “start” and “end” block tags.
1 
The alpha character in the tag is used to indicate which format option has been applied. If the alpha character in the tag is lowercase in
the SWIFT format documentation, this means that there are several format options for the field and that there is free choice to use any of
these options. If the alpha character in the tag is uppercase, this means that, while there are several format options for the field, the option
designated by the uppercase alpha character must be used. GSD has mandated the options that Members must use in the layouts.

Message Formatting Rules
The f ollowing Message and Message Field rules apply to all interactive messages used to support GSD’s
products and services:
Message Rules
Message Rules
1 Direction Messages are sent either to or from GSD
2 Variable Length All messages can vary in length up to a maximum allowable number of characters
per message type
3 Header All messages begin with a standard fixed length header
4 Terminator All messages end with a standard terminator sequence reflected by a Carriage
Return/Line Feed (“CRLF”) and a Dash (“–”)
5 Message Type Each message belongs to a specified message type
6 Message Fields A message is composed of one or more message fields
7 Character Set A-Z, a-z, 0-9, white space and the following punctuation “:/,-”
Message Field Rules
Message Field Rules
1 Field Tag Each field begins with a field tag
2 Tag Format Each tag is composed of 2 digits and an optional character (2!c[1a])
3 Tag Delimiter Each tag is prefixed and suffixed by the character “:” (e.g., :23G:)
4 Field Data Field data (including qualifiers and sub-qualifiers) immediately follows the tag suffix
delimiter. Generic tags are prefixed by an additional “:”
5 Data Format Data conforms to format rules for a specified tag
6 Data Elements Field data may be divided into multiple elements or sub fields
7 Qualifiers Qualifiers within a data field provide additional format definition. If a qualifier is used,
it must appear immediately after the tag suffix delimiter (e.g., :98A::SETT). If further
data is required after the qualifier, and the data complies with SWIFT standards, the
qualifier is delimited by the characters “//” and the data follows (e.g.,
:98A::SETT//20200928 or :20C::MAST//202000928815). If the data is GSD specific,
then the GSD issuer code is included (e.g., :95R::BUYR/GSCC/PART88T2).
8 Field Delimiter The field delimiter sequence is Carriage Return Line Feed , “CRLF” (“CR” is
represented by ASCII Character 13 and “LF” is represented by ASCII Character 10).
This sequence immediately follows the data. The combination of Carriage Return
Line Feed, Colon (“CRLF:”) indicates the end of one field and the beginning of the
next.

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Overview 12
Formatting Conventions
All the layouts for each of the messages included in this document are organized using the following columns
of data:
Column Heading Description
M/O The M/O column defines whether the field is always Mandatory or is Optional in the particular
message according to SWIFT standards. This column does not provide information as to whether
the field is required or optional for FICC GSD. Refer to the Appendix A, which provides a list of
required fields for both REPO and CASH trades.
Tag The Tag column defines the exact tag value that must precede the field. Tags are always
delimited by “:” (meaning a “:” would be the character immediately before and after the tag (e.g.,
“:98A:” indicates a date with a format of YYYYMMDD will follow).
Block/Qualifier The Block or Qualifier column specifies the Block Name in the case of a start of block (16R) or
end of block (16S) tag. Otherwise, it specifies the required qualifier for the tag (e.g., :98A::SETT
indicates a Settlement Date field).
Sub-qualifier/Options The Options column specifies the different options available for individual qualifiers for a tag.
Each tag, qualifier and option combination uniquely specifies a data element (e.g.,
90A::DEAL//YIEL/ indicates a trade price will follow with a “yield” price type).
Field Description The Field Description column provides a text description of the purpose or use of a data field.
Data Field Format The Data Field Format column specifies the size and characters allowed within a data field, as
specified by SWIFT. The Field Specifications that follow each layout indicate how each field
should be populated for GSD input/output. The format provided in this column reflects the data
that the Member must populate the field with (e.g., :98A::SETT// has a format of YYYYMMDD).
It should be reiterated that the Mandatory/Optional (M/O) Field on the layout indicates if the field is SWIFT
mandatory or optional for the message/sequence. It does not denote, however, if the field is required for
submission to GSD. Fields that are SWIFT mandatory and/or GSD mandatory must be reflected on the MT515,
or the message (Instruct, Modify, Cancel, or DK) will be rejected.
The Data Format field on the layouts is intended to reflect the format of the data that Members and/or GSD
must use to populate the field. For example, the format for the Settlement Date field (:98A::SETT//20200928) is
ref lected as “YYYYMMDD.”
All f ields are, by definition, variable in length with a maximum field size specified, unless a fixed length format is
def ined by inclusion of the “!”, in which case the size specified is the fixed field size. In the case where the data
value in the f ixed length field is smaller than the field size specified, the data should be left justified with trailing
blanks. There are not only differences in data field sizes (as noted previously in this document), but field
f ormats can also be different for the population of the SWIFT standard. For example, date fields on the GSD
MT515, MT509 and MT518 SWIFT records are ref lected as “YYYYMMDD” rather than the SWIFT f ormat of
“MMDDYYYY”, which is also used on the GSD proprietary layout. Another difference can be found in the
commission field. On the SWIFT standard format, the commission is reflected as “amount per trade”, whereas
on the GSD proprietary format the commission is stated as a percentage.
In addition, all fields on the SWIFT messages are left justified, and if the field has a decimal format (d), it must
use a decimal comma, rather than a decimal (i.e. 50.01 should be 50,01).

Generic f ields, as previously described in this document, are designed to serve a particular function, with a
qualif ier code specifying a specific business purpose to that function. In the preceding example, the “20C” tag
is a generic ref erence number, and the “SEME” qualifier in the GENL block indicates that this is the Sender’s
Message identifier. In the LINK subsequence, however, 20C is used to provide a Master Reference Number
(Member’s External Reference). The generic fields can thereby be designed to be reused for creating or
validating generic fields as the fields are reused within a message, or across messages.

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Overview 14
Communications Overview
GSD employs MQ Series as a message exchange facility to support reliable submission of trade messages
and delivery of status messages. As noted in the Introduction, currently GSD does not use the SWIFT network
as a communications facility. GSD will, however, attempt to comply with SWIFT format standards to facilitate
the transition to the SWIFT network, should it be deemed desirable in the future. Previously, GSD implemented
the Participant Access Network as a TCP/IP communications facility to support a reliable, secure connection to
Members’ systems. These facilities are explained in further detail below.
Message Exchange
A message exchange facility is used by GSD to support the receipt of trade messages and delivery of status
and advisory messages to/from Member systems. A message exchange facility requires support for the
implementation of queues, which are typically time-ordered lists of messages (trade messages, cancellation
messages, status messages, etc.). This allows Member and/or vendor systems, as applicable, to generate
trade messages as trades are executed, and these trade messages are “queued” onto the “To GSD” queue. If
the communications connection is enabled (including all the links, from the dial-up or leased line up to the
messaging product itself), then the message is immediately sent to GSD. Otherwise, messages will
accumulate on the queue until a connection is completely established.
The same procedure holds true on the return side, meaning as GSD processes trades from trade acceptance
through comparison (and eventually through netting), the status updates will be queued for delivery back to
Member and/or vendor systems, as applicable. Member and/or vendor systems must have a connection
enabled and a program (e.g., a process or thread) that is waiting for messages to appear on the “From GSD”
queue in order to process GSD responses interactively. Additional details, including the full naming convention
that will be utilized, will be distributed to Members separately.

Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT515 15
COMPARISON INTERACTIVE MESSAGE SPECIFICATIONS
– MT515
This section contains the detailed specifications including layout and field descriptions for MT515 Messages
supporting comparison input for GSD’s products and services. The MT515 Message is considered a Trade
Input Message and is used by GSD Members to submit trade details to GSD.
MT515 Trade Input Message Description
The SWIFT MT515 is specified as a Client Confirmation of Purchase or Sale. It can also serve as a binding
electronic contract. The MT515 message will be used by GSD Members (including a Demand Trade Source)
and authorized Locked-in submitters to submit trades to GSD, to enter trade cancellations, to modify the
Member ref erence numbers on previously submitted trades, and to DK trades submitted against them.
Field 22F PROC in the Confirmation Details (CONFDET) block will enable the Member to indicate to GSD the
type of record being sent. Additionally, field :70E:: TPRO// can indicate the reason for the event occurring
preceded by the mnemonic MSGR (message reason). On DK messages this field will also provide the reason
f or the DK having been submitted against the recipient’s trade (preceded by the mnemonic “DKRS” (DK
reason)). A MT515 Message may be sent by a GSD Member or authorized Locked-in submitter for the
f ollowing trade inputs and products as detailed below:
• DVP: regular buy/sell, repo/revr, auction buy/sell
• GCF: repo/revr (DK messages does not apply to this product)
• CCIT: repo/revr (DK messages does not apply to this product)
Message Type This message is used to: DVP GCF CCIT
Instruct Message
(:22F::PROC/GSCC/INST)
submit trade details to GSD for regular buy/sell transactions
and repurchase agreements (“repos”) executed by
Members (including a Demand Trade Source) or approved
Locked-in submitters. This message will support:
1) all fields required to effect trade comparison; and
2) certain other SWIFT and GSD mandatory and optional
fields.
  
Cancel Message
(:22F::PROC/GSCC/CANC)
initiate the cancellation of a previously submitted trade. A
Cancel Message should be an exact copy of an Instruct
Message, and as such will contain full trade details. The
Cancel Message should contain the last version of the
trade details as it is on the GSD system.
Once a trade has been fully canceled, a new trade may be
submitted using the same Member reference number as
the original Instruct message. Otherwise the new instruct
will be rejected for using the same Member external
reference number.

Message Type This message is used to: DVP GCF CCIT
• If the trade is not Locked-in and the trade has already
been bilaterally compared, then both parties must submit a
Cancel Message.
• If the trade has not been bilaterally compared or it has
been recorded and registered based on the input of a valid
Locked-in submitter, only the original, or Locked-in
submitter can submit a Cancel Message for the trade.
• If the counterparty of a Locked-in trade (Locked-in
recipient), submitted by an authorized Locked-in submitter,
enters a Cancel Message, the Locked-in submitter will
receive a Cancel Request.
Modify Message
(:22F::PROC/GSCC/MDFC)
submit a modification to a previously entered trade.
Currently, the only field that may be modified using this
SWIFT message type will be the Member Reference
Number.
In order to modify any other trade information via an
MT515, the trade must be canceled and resubmitted (using
a Cancel Message and a new Instruct Message) or submit
your modifications via the GSD Real-Time Trade Matching
(RTTM
® 
) Web application. Note: On bilaterally compared
trades, only reference Numbers can be modified via the
GSD RTTM Web application.
  
DK Message
(:22F::PROC/GSCC/TDDK)
submit a notification to GSD (and the Counterparty) that it
does not know, or agree with, the trade submitted against it
by the Counterparty. The DK message will reflect the entire
details of the Comparison Request received by the DK’ing
party, along with a reason for the DK.

Note:
Members utilizing interactive input will submit data to GSD in real-time as trades/events occur, and immediate notification
regarding the trade’s status will be generated via the MT509 Message by GSD.

MT515 Trade Input Message Field Specifications
This section provides the detailed field specifications for the MT515 Message.
Block/Tag Notes
Message
Header
Each message must contain a Message Header. All header fields are mandatory fixed format
with trailing blanks, where required.
Password 12!c A unique identifier will be assigned by GSD enabling the sender to submit trades on
behalf of specific member(s).
Sender 8!c Member ID
Message Type 3!n/3!n/4!c The first 3 characters indicate to the recipient the message type (515); the second 3
positions reflect the version of the message interface (currently always 000). The last
4 characters indicate the issuer code to be used in the message (GSCC).
Receiver 8!c “GSCCTRRS” (GSD Trade Registration and Reconciliation System) for DVP,
“GCFCTRRS” (GCF Trade Registration and Reconciliation System) for GCF/CCIT will
always be the recipient of the MT515 messages.
GENL This mandatory block provides general information regarding the message. It appears only
once in a trade contract.
20C Sender's Message Reference
• SEME// – This field contains the sender’s message reference number. It is mandatory and
must contain a unique number to unambiguously identify each message sent to GSD. This
is a communications message number, not a trade number. It is suggested that members
use a number that includes a date followed by either a time stamp or a sequence number.
This way uniqueness can be ensured.
e.g., :20C::SEME//100120065614SA9
Note:
This field must be populated with an uppercase alphanumeric value. It cannot contain symbols or
hyphens.
23G Function of the Message
This mandatory field identifies the function of the message. It will either be a new message (NEWM)
for an Instruct, Modify or DK, or a cancellation (CANC) of a previous message. GSD does not support
the Replace (REPL) message via interactive messaging. Members must submit a cancel (CANC) and
a new trade (NEWM) to replace a previously existing trade in the system. Members may choose to
retain their original reference number on the new trade, or use a new reference number, where
desired.
• NEWM – will be used for a new trade, a trade modification or DK message.
• CANC – will be used to request the cancellation of a trade..
e.g., :23G:NEWM
98C Preparation Date and Time
• PREP// – This field contains the date and time the message sent to GSD was prepared.
e.g., :98C::PREP//20201001113328

Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT515 23
Block/Tag Notes
Note:
The “C” Format for this (98) tag indicates a Date/Time Format of “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS”.
22F Trade Transaction Type Indicator (TRTR)
This mandatory field specifies whether the trade is cash or repo and if the trade is Bilateral, Locked-in
or Demand.
• TRTR/GSCC/CASH – This qualifier/option should be used on buy/sell trades requiring two -
sided (Bilateral) comparison.
• TRTR/GSCC/REPO – This qualifier/option should be used on repo trades requiring Bilateral
comparison.
• TRTR/GSCC/TRLK – This qualifier/option should be used on Locked-in cash trades.
• TRTR/GSCC/TRLR – This qualifier/option should be used on Locked-in repo trades.
• TRTR/GSCC/TRDC – This qualifier/option should be used on Demand cash trades.
• TRTR/GSCC/TRDR – This qualifier/option should be used on Demand repo trades.
e.g., :22F::TRTR/GSCC/TRDR
LINK The LINK Block will be repeated for the various reference qualifiers required on a Trade
Contract. It is intended to provide the required information to identify the trade. Each
Reference Number must be enclosed within a Start Link Block (:16R:LINK) and End Link Block
(:16S:LINK). Each LINK repeating subsequence is within the GENL Block. At least one LINK
sequence is required on the MT515 Message.
20C Reference
The Reference Numbers provided by the Member must contain uppercase alphanumeric
characters - and must not contain symbols or hyphens. As indicated above, each reference number
must be enclosed in a LINK Start and End block. MT515 DK messages (submitted against
counterparty trades) will not contain reference numbers in this sequence but require the MAST
qualifier to be included on the record.
• MAST// – Master Reference Number – This qualifier contains the Member’s Reference
Number for the trade (External Reference Number). This field must be unique for an
Instruct and should be populated with the primary reference number that the Member will
use to track trades on the GSD system. It is mandatory for inbound MT515 INSTRUCT
and DK messages. For DKs, this field should be populated with the value “NONREF”. For
Cancels and Modifies, the Member can elect to send either the External Reference
Number (MAST) or the GSD Reference Number (LIST).
• PREV// – Previous Reference Number – This qualifier is used on either Trade Modify or
Trade Cancel MT515 records. On Modify records, it is used to modify the reference
number and should contain the Member’s Previous External Reference Number. For
MT515 Cancel records you are submitting (:23G:CANC and :22F::PROC/GSCC/CANC in
the Confirmation Details (CONFDET) block), this field should be populated with the value
“NONREF”. This field will not be used on Instruct or DK records.
• LIST// – GSD Reference Number – This qualifier contains GSD’s assigned reference
number (TID) for the trade. This field can be used on Modify and Cancel records, and
where supplied, this will be used by GSD to identify the trade, rather than the reference
provided in the Master Reference Number Field (MAST). For Cancels and Modifies, the
Member can elect to send either the External Reference Number (MAST) or the GSD
Reference Number (LIST). This field will not be used on Instruct or DK records.

e.g., :98A::SETT//20191124
90A Deal Price
This field is reflected on all messages. It contains the Execution Price Type and Price. Only one tag
“90A” is allowed per trade contract. The price is left justified, with commas removed, and a comma
used instead of a decimal. The following price types may be specified:
• DEAL//PRCT/ – This qualifier/option is used for dollar prices and repo rates. Where the trade
is a repo, however, the price portion of the field must be populated with “0,”. Repo rates will
be populated in the REPO Block.
• DEAL//YIEL/ – This qualifier/option is used for Yield priced trades. This qualifier/option
cannot be used on messages for repo trades.
• DEAL//DISC/ – This qualifier/option is used for Discount Rates. This qualifier/option cannot
be used on messages for repo trades.

case of a cash trade, or a reverse, in the case of a repo trade.
• BUSE//SELL – This qualifier/option indicates that the trade submitted is either a sell, in the
case of a cash trade, or a repo, in the case of a repo trade.
e.g., :22H::BUSE//BUYI
Note:
The inclusion of a REPO block and the use of a Repo qualifier in Tag 22F (TRTR/GSCC/REPO,
TRTR/GSCC/TRLR or TRTR/GSCC/TRDR) in the GENL block will indicate that the trade is a repo
trade, rather than a cash trade.

• /DKRS – Should be used to specify the reason for the DK. The 4-character code can be
found in Appendix E of this document.
e.g., :70E::TPRO//GSCC/DKRSE009
CONFPRTY The Mandatory Confirming Party Block must be repeated for each party to a trade. Each party
specified must be enclosed within a Start Party block (:16R:CONFPRTY) and End Party block
(:16S:CONFPRTY). Please note that on every trade there should be at least two (one buyer and
one seller) repeating Confirming Party sequences, and one of these parties will also be the

Block/Tag Notes
e.g., :70E::DECL//GSCC/CORREXFIRM
Note:
Only executing firm symbols with documented and established relationships in the GSD system should
be entered in this field.
70C Party Narrative (PACO)
This field will be used in the appropriate buyer or seller confirming party sequence on MT515 Instructs,
Cancels or Modifies submitted to provide information regarding the individual/desk at the counterparty
that executed the trade. It should be noted that the trader ID field is for informational purposes only
and will be captured for the purposes of passing the information to the counterparty on MT518
Comparison Request messages. This field will not be compared or validated, nor will it be a basis for
rejection or DK capabilities.
• PACO//GSCC – denotes Member contact narrative information specific to GSD.
• /TDID – should be used in the appropriate BUYR or SELL confirming party sequence to
indicate the following:
o on MT515 Instruct, Cancel or Modify Records, this qualifier should be used by the
submitter to indicate the buyer or seller counterparty ID of the trader that executed
the trade.
o on MT515 DK messages, this qualifier should be used to reflect the buying or selling
submitter’s ID of the trader that executed the trade (as originally submitted by the
counterparty).
e.g., :70C::PACO//GSCC/TDIDMARK15
SETDET This Optional block, and the AMT subsequence, are necessary only when commission is
specified on the trade. Currently, GSD accepts commission on When Issue (WI) trades for
coupon bearing instruments submitted prior to auction, or on Repo trades.
22F Settlement Transaction Indicator (SETR)
This field is mandatory for the Block.
• SETR//RPTO – Indicates that this trade confirmation is for reporting purposes only.
e.g., :22F::SETR//RPTO
Note:
This field is not used by GSD although it is SWIFT mandatory in order to support the inclusion of the
Commission Amount field.
AMT As indicated above, this Optional sequence is only necessary to support the inclusion of
broker commission on a WI trade or a commission amount on a Repo Trade. This block should
always be included within the Settlement Details (SETDET) block.
17B Standing Instructions Override
This field is mandatory for the Block.
• STAN//N – This indicates that standing instructions should not be overridden.
e.g., :17B::STAN//N

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT515 28
Block/Tag Notes
Note:
This field is not used by GSD although it is SWIFT mandatory in order to support the inclusion of the
Commission Amount field.
19A Broker’s Commission
LOCO//USD – This field specifies the broker’s commission amount on WI trades or Repo trades. The
commission amount field is left justified, with commas removed, and a comma used in lieu of a
decimal. The amount must be preceded by a 3-character ISO currency code.
e.g., :19A::LOCO//USD55,
Note:
The value in this field is an AMOUNT - this differs from the rate field format within the GSD system. The
Commission Amount per trade should be included in this field – e.g., where the commission is $40 per
million, for a two million dollar trade the field should be displayed “LOCO//USD80,”.
Note:
The commission amount submitted for a Repo trade should not be included in the net money. GSD will
not process the value in this field for Repo trades.
REPO The Optional Repo Block appears only on trade contract involving a repurchase/ reverse
repurchase trade. It appears only once in the contract. Its inclusion indicates that the trade is
either a Repo or Reverse trade, based on the BUSE indicator in the CONFDET Block (BUYI =
Reverse, SELL = Repo). This block must be included on a MT515 record for a Repo trade.
98A Repurchase Date

COMPARISON INTERACTIVE MESSAGE SPECIFICATIONS
– MT509
This section contains the detailed specifications including layout and field descriptions for MT509 Messages
supporting comparison output for GSD’s products and services.
MT509 Trade Status Message Description
The SWIFT MT509 Message is specified as a Trade Status Message and will be used by GSD as a means to
communicate status messages related to the GSD Comparison process. The MT509 Message does not
contain full trade details, but rather provides the trade status along with the full set of reference numbers to
enable the Member to identify the trade being reported on (e.g., Member Reference Number, Secondary
Ref erence Number, Counterparty External Reference Number, Broker Reference Number (or Broker TID) and
the GSD Assigned Reference Number (Receiver’s TID), where appropriate).
Certain status messages also include additional fields, such as reason codes for reject messages, etc. Field
25D in the Status (STAT) Block indicates to the recipient the type of record being sent. In the case of a Modify
or DK reject, a second field, 70D in the Reason (REAS) block, must also be read to determine the record type.
These MT509 Messages also contain a “Ack” (Accepted/Validated) or “Nack” (Rejected) Status unlike the
MT509 Netting Status Messages. The qualifiers representing the type of record being sent in Field 25D, are
shown below.
As it relates to GSD’s Comparison process, MT509 Messages will be generated for each of the following
products and trade statuses seen below:
• DVP: regular buy/sell, repo/revr, auction buy/sell (Trade Balanced does not apply)
• GCF: repo/revr (Repo Substitution Processed, DK Rejected, DK Accepted, DK Processed, Trade
Canceled due to DK, Trade Compared through Par Summarization, Cancel Lifted by Participant do not
apply to this product)
• CCIT: repo/revr (Repo Substitution Processed, DK Rejected, DK Accepted, DK Processed, Trade
Canceled due to DK, Trade Compared through Par Summarization, Cancel Lifted by Participant, Trade
Balanced do not apply to this product)
Message Type This message will be sent to: DVP GCF CCIT

Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT509 49
Block/Tag Notes
LINK The LINK Block will be repeated for as many reference qualifiers as need to be included in a
Trade Status Message. Each subsequence contains reference numbers to identify the trade or
record for which the status is being reported. Each reference number will be enclosed within a
Start Link Block (:16R:LINK) and End Link Block (:16S:LINK). All LINK repeating subsequences
are within the GENL Block.
20C Reference
The Reference Numbers that have been provided by Members must contain uppercase
alphanumeric characters and should not contain symbols. As indicated above, each Reference
Number will be enclosed in a LINK Start and End Block.
• MAST// – Master Reference Number - This qualifier contains the Member’s Reference
Number for the trade (External Reference Number). The MAST qualifier will be present on
all MT509’s except where an MT515 message was rejected for being non-SWIFT
compliant and on MT509’s referring to MT515 DK records submitted.
• PREV// – Previous Reference Number - This qualifier is used only on records where the
External Reference Number has been modified by the Member and will contain the
Member’s Previous Reference Number.
• RELA// – MT515 Sender's Message Reference Number - This qualifier will contain the
Sender’s Message Reference Number (20C::SEME//) from the MT515 submitted by the
Member. It will only appear on those MT509 messages, which are acknowledgements of
receipt, or rejections, of MT515 Member messages.
• INDX// – Secondary Reference Number - This qualifier will contain the Member’s
Secondary Reference Number on Status Messages for Repo Trades, where the number
was originally provided by the Member.
• LIST// – GSD Reference Number - This qualifier will contain the GSD Reference Number
(TID - Transaction Identification) for the trade.
• PROG// – Counterparty Reference Number - This field reflects the Counterparty
External Reference Number. It will only appear on MT509 messages related to
Comparison Notification (e.g., Trade Compared (:25D::MTCH//MACH), and on MT509
messages providing the status of MT515 DK records submitted to GSD.)
• BASK// – Broker Reference Number - This field specifies the Member’s (or
Counterparty's) Broker Reference, either a GSD Assigned Reference Number (TID)
assigned to the Broker’s Trade or a Broker External Reference provided by the Broker.
This field is required for Broker Submitted Trades. The Broker Reference Number field will
be preceded by a Linked Message Trade Indicator field. The only exception to this would
be if the record being reported is due to an input, modify, DK or cancel rejected or DK
accepted.
e.g., :20C::MAST//PARTNUM1
Note:
On MT509 Trade Status messages, the Broker External Reference will appear in this field. One
exception to this rule is for MT509 Trade Compared (MACH) messages. For MT509 Trade
Compared (MACH) messages sent intra-day, where the receiving Member is the Broker
counterparty to a Brokered Demand Same-Day Starting Repo Transaction where either the Start
Leg and/or End Leg of such transaction is eligible for settlement through GSD's Same-Day Settling
Service, the Broker's GSD Assigned Reference Number (TID) will appear in this field.

MT509 Trade Status Message Field Analysis
This section contains an analysis of the fields that may be found on each MT509 Comparison Message. The analysis is separated into two categories;
1) Trade Input, Modify or DK and 2) Trade Cancel and Match. For each applicable record type, a check mark will be found where it is possible for that
f ield to appear on that record. It should be noted, however, that where a check mark appears, the check mark is not intended to indicate that a f ield is
mandatory for a given record type. Where there is no check mark in a given box, that field is not applicable for the record type in question.

Receiver 8!c Member ID
GENL This mandatory block provides general information regarding the message. It appears only once
in a trade confirm.
20C Sender's Message Reference
• SEME// – This mandatory field contains the sender’s (GSD) message reference number. It is
used on all messages and will contain a unique number to unambiguously identify each
message sent by GSD. This is a communications message number, not a trade number.
e.g., :20C::SEME//2019GSDCMPMESS1
Note:
This field must be populated with an uppercase alphanumeric value. It cannot contain symbols or
hyphens.
23G Function of the Message
This mandatory field is used on all messages to identify the function of the message. It will either be a
new message (NEWM) related to an Instruct, Modify or DK, or the cancellation of a previous trade
(CANC).
• NEWM – This qualifier will be used for a new trade, a trade modification, or a DK message.
• CANC – This qualifier will be used for various cancellation messages.
e.g., :23G:NEWM
98C Preparation Date and Time
• PREP// – This field will be reflected on all messages to indicate the date and time the message
sent by GSD was prepared.
e.g., :98C::PREP//20191124113533
Note:
The “C” Format for this (98) tag indicates a Date/Time Format of “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS”.

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT518 72
Block/Tag Notes
22F Trade Transaction Type Indicator (TRTR)
This field specifies that the trade is being reported as a Repo and whether the trade is Demand or
requires bilateral comparison.
• TRTR/GSCC/CASH – This qualifier/option should be used on buy/sell trades requiring two -
sided (Bilateral) comparison.
• TRTR/GSCC/REPO – This qualifier/option should be used on repo trades requiring Bilateral
comparison.
• TRTR/GSCC/TRLK – This qualifier/option should be used on Locked-in cash trades.

• TRTR/GSCC/TRDC – This qualifier/option should be used on Demand cash trades.
• TRTR/GSCC/TRDR – This qualifier/option should be used on Demand repo trades.
e.g., :22F::TRTR/GSCC/TRDR
LINK The LINK Block can be repeated for as many reference qualifiers as need to be included in a
Trade Confirm. It is intended to provide the required information to identify the trade. Each
reference number must be enclosed within a Start Link Block (:16R:LINK) and End Link Block
(:16S:LINK). Each LINK repeating subsequence is within the GENL Block.
20C Reference
This set of fields in the MT518 will contain the relevant reference numbers associated with your trade.
The four types of reference numbers that may appear in the LINK block are:
1) the Master Reference Number (MAST), generally referred to as the external reference number
or x-ref
2) the Previous Reference Number for the trade (PREV)
3) the GSD Reference Number (LIST), also referred to as the Trade ID or TID
4) the Broker Reference Number (BASK).
The data provided in these reference number fields for any given trade are determined based upon a
number of criteria. These include submitter type (broker, dealer or Locked-in submitter), message
category (advisory, Locked-in Trade advices or advices referring to trades submitted by the message
receiver (“your trades”), and message type (Cancel, Modify, etc.). The basic rules for reporting data for
each reference number type are provided below.
It should be noted that, on MT518 Advisories, where counterparty trade reference numbers are provided,
the counterparty’s external as well as previous reference numbers will appear in the appropriate Buyer or
Seller Confirming Party Subsequence. They will not appear in this subsequence.
• MAST// – Master Reference Number - On advices referring to the receiving Member’s (your)
trades, this field will contain your external reference number. On Locked-in Trade Advices
supporting Locked-in or Demand trades, this field will contain the external reference number
generated by GSD on your behalf. This field will not appear on advisories.
• PREV// – Previous Reference Number - Under most circumstances, this field will not appear
on MT518’s (advisories, Locked-in Trade advices, or advices referring to the receiving
Member’s (your) trades).
o One exception to this rule is for Cancels. There is a SWIFT requirement that the data
field associated with the “PREV” qualifier be populated on all MT518 and MT515
cancel (:23G:CANC) records. All MT518 Cancel records will therefore reflect the PREV
qualifier populated with the value “NONREF”.
o The second exception to this rule is for Screen Input Trade Replay Records
(:22F::PROC/GSCC/SITR) where the Member has made entries on a GSD terminal.

GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT518 73
Block/Tag Notes
For these trades, the data field associated with the PREV qualifier will be populated as
follows:
 If the screen input was a trade cancellation, the data field associated with the
PREV qualifier will be populated with “NONREF”.
 If the screen input was a trade modification, which included the modification
of an external reference number, the data field associated with the PREV
qualifier will contain the Member’s Previous External Reference Number.
 At this point in time, this field will not appear under any other circumstances.
As indicated above, if the counterparty has changed its external reference number, the
counterparty’s previous reference number will appear.
• LIST// – GSD Reference Number – On Locked-in trade advices, for Locked-in or Demand
trades, and advices referring to the receiving Member’s (your) trades, this field will contain the
GSD Assigned Reference Number (TID) for the trade. This field will not appear on advisories.
• BASK// – Broker Reference Number - For trades submitted by brokers, this field will contain
the Broker’s Reference Number on advices, referring to the broker’s trade. This field will not
appear on advisories or Locked-in trade advices.
e.g., :20C::MAST//PARTREF2019
Note:
This field must be populated with an uppercase alphanumeric value. It will not contain symbols or
hyphens except where the reference number has been assigned by GSD.
CONFDET The CONFDET (Confirmation Details) block appears only once in a Trade Contract. It contains
Trade and Confirming Party Details.
98C Trade Date
• TRAD// – This field is used on all messages to specify Trade Date and Trade Time. (The “C”
format for this (98) tag indicates a Date/Time Format of “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS”.)
e.g., :98C::TRAD//20191125105153
98A Settlement Date
• SETT// – This field is used on all messages to specify the Settlement Date for a cash trade, or
the Start Leg Settlement Date, in case of a repo. The “A” Format for this tag (98) indicates a
Date Format of “YYYYMMDD”.
e.g., :98A::SETT//20191124
90A Deal Price
This field is reflected on all MT518 messages. It contains the Execution Price Type and Price. Only one
Tag 90A is allowed per trade contract. The following price types may be specified:
• DEAL//PRCT/ – This qualifier/option is used for dollar prices and repo rates. Where the trade is
a repo, however, the price portion of the field must be populated with “0,”. Repo rates can be
found in the REPO Block.
• DEAL//YIEL/ – This qualifier/option is used for Yield priced trades.
• DEAL//DISC/ – This qualifier/option is used for Discount Rates.
e.g., :90A::DEAL//PRCT/0

Block/Tag Notes
Note:
The GSD system supports a size of 14d. The field should only be populated with a value no larger than
14d.
19A Settlement Amount
• SETT// – This field is used to specify the Settlement Amount for buy/sell trades and the Start
Leg Settlement Amount for Repo trades.
The amount is left justified, with commas removed, and a comma used instead of a decimal.

of a cash trade, or a reverse, in the case of a repo trade.
• BUSE//SELL – This qualifier/option indicates that the record represents either a sell, in the case
of a cash trade, or a repo, in the case of a repo trade.
e.g., :22H::BUSE//BUYI
Note:
The inclusion of a REPO block and the use of a Repo qualifier in Tag 22F (TRTR/GSCC/REPO,
TRTR/GSCC/TRLR or TRTR/GSCC/TRDR) in the GENL block will indicate that the trade is a repo trade,
rather than a cash trade.

trades. The commission amount field is left justified, with commas removed, and a comma used
in lieu of a decimal. The amount must be preceded by a 3-character ISO currency code.
e.g., :19A::LOCO//USD40,
Note:
The value in this field is an AMOUNT - this differs from the rate field format within the GSD system. The
Commission Amount per trade should be included in this field – e.g., where the commission is $40 per
million, for a two million dollar trade the field should be displayed “LOCO//USD80,”.
Note:
The commission amount submitted for a Repo trade should not be included in the net money.
REPO 
The Repo Block appears only on trade confirm involving a repurchase/reverse repurchase trade.
It appears only once in the confirm. Its inclusion indicates that the trade is either a Repo or
Reverse trade based on the BUY/SELL indicator in the CONFDET Block (BUYI = Reverse, SELL =
Repo).
98A Repurchase Date
• REPU// – This Mandatory field specifies the Repo End Leg Settlement Date in the format
“YYYYMMDD”.
e.g., :98A::REPU//20191127
20C Secondary Reference
• SECO// – This field is optional, but if used, should include the qualifier “SECO” to support an
additional reference number for the Member’s REPO trade. This field will be populated on
MT518 records related to your trade, and where included on the MT518, will reflect your
Secondary Reference Number. Advisories will not reflect the Counterparty Secondary
Reference Number.
e.g., :20C::SECO//2NDREFNUM
Note:
This field must be populated with an uppercase alphanumeric value. It cannot contain symbols or
hyphens.
92A Repo Rate
• REPO// – The Mandatory REPO Rate field is left justified, with a comma inserted in lieu of a
decimal.
e.g., :92A::REPO//2,75

Block/Tag Notes
Note:
The GSD system supports a size of 14d. The field should only be populated with a value no larger than
14d.
19A Repurchase Amount
• REPA// – The End Leg Settlement Amount is always prefixed by the ISO currency code (USD)
and is left-justified with commas removed, and a comma used in lieu of a decimal.
e.g., :19A::REPA//USD26075000,
Note:
This field can accommodate a value of 15d.

MT518 Contra-Side Message Field Analysis
This section contains an analysis of the fields that may be found on each MT518 Contra-Side Trade Status Message. The analysis is separated into two
categories; 1) Advisories and Locked-in Advices and 2) Advices Referring to Receiving Member’s (Your) Trades. For each applicable record type, a
check mark will be found where it is possible for that field to appear on that record. It should be noted, however, that where a check mark appears, the
check mark is not intended to indicate that a f ield is mandatory for a given record type. Where there is no check mark in a given box, that field is not
applicable for the record type in question.

Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT599 100
COMPARISON INTERACTIVE MESSAGE SPECIFICATIONS
– MT599
This section contains the detailed specifications including layout and field descriptions for the MT599
Messages supporting output for GSD’s products and services.
MT599 Administrative Message Description
The SWIFT MT599 Administrative Message is a free-format SWIFT message which GSD utilizes to
communicate administrative messages to Members (and their service providers, as applicable). GSD also uses
this message type to notify Members regarding start and end-of-day processing, as well as cutoffs for trade
inputs (e.g. DK cutoff).
The f ollowing MT599 Messages may be generated to provided system administrative information to Members:
Message Type This message is used to: DVP GCF/
CCIT
GSD Start-of-Day Notification
(:79:GSCC/GADM/PREP/ …/GSOD/)
inform a Member at the beginning of each business day that the
GSD system is available for the submission of trades to be
included for that days’ processing.
 
GSD Demand Trade Submission
Cutoff Message
(:79:GSCC/GADM/PREP/ …/SCDM/)
inform Members when then may no longer submit transactions for
demand comparison for that day. Any transactions submitted to
GSD after this point will be submitted for bilateral comparison.

GSD DK Submission Cutoff Message
(:79:GSCC/GADM/PREP/ …/SCDK/)
inform Members when they may no longer submit DK notices on
demand trades submitted against them by a counterparty. Any DK
notices submitted after this point will be rejected.

GSD Submission Cutoff End-of-Day
Message
(:79:GSCC/GADM/PREP/ …/EDCS/)
inform Members when then may no longer submit transactions to
be included for processing for that day. Any transactions
submitted to GSD after this point will be included in the next
business day’s comparison processing.
Note:
No acknowledgements or rejections will be sent to Members for
trades submitted after this point until the system is next available
(after the ‘/GSOD/’ start-of-day message is sent).
 
GSD Processing End-of-Day
Message
(:79:GSCC/GADM/PREP/ …/EODC/)
inform Members that the GSD system has completed batch
processing for that business day, and that all interactive output to
be generated that day has been transmitted. At this point no more
interactive messages will be sent by GSD for that business day.
 
GSD GCF/CCIT Net Processing
Message
(:79:GSCC/GADM/PREP/ …/SNET)
inform Members that the GSD system has commenced the
GCF/CCIT Netting process for that business day.


GSD Interactive Messaging (IM) Member Specifications for Comparison Input & Output
Comparison Interactive Message Specifications – MT599 101
MT599 Administrative Message Specifications
All MT599 messages sent by GSD will provide the Member with the date and time of message preparation and
the date f or the business day in question. End-of-day messages will also contain the next GSD valid trade
submission date.
One start-of-day message will be sent out for each business day, when the GSD system is open for trade
submission (DVP and GCF/CCIT messages will be sent out separately):
• /GSOD/
Two end-of -day messages will be sent to Members nightly (DVP and GCF/CCIT messages will be sent out
separately):
• /EDCS/
• /EODC/
Other cutoff and end-of-day messages that will be sent to Members, as applicable:
• /SCDM/
• /SCDK/
• /SNET/
Note:
/NXTD/ - This qualifier will not appear as a standalone in any MT599 message. It will appear in conjunction with SCDM,
SCDK, EDCS and EODC qualifiers.
MT599 Administrative Message Format Differences
It is important to note that these MT599 messages are based on an older SWIFT message type, which is
slightly different in format from the other ISO 15022 messages implemented to support GSD’s Real-time
Comparison process.
As can be noted on the following pages:
• there is no Start or End of Block tags (16R and 16S),
• tags do not always include the optional 1-character format suffix, and
• there are no generic fields, qualifiers or repeating sequences.
We have included qualifiers in Tag 79 in an attempt to maintain similar formats to other messages
implemented, given that any type of text can be included in narrative fields. GSD, for this purpose, has
attempted to delineate, and label, the ‘sub fields’ included in this tag in a similar manner to those on other
messages in the interactive messaging specifications distributed. Tag 79 will provide a ref erence to the record
type being sent, which always follows the message preparation date and time.

sent by GSD followed by:
• /PREP/ – this field contains the message preparation date and time, and either
• /GSOD/ – this qualifier indicates to Members that this MT599 message is GSD’s beginning of
day notification for the business date noted. Subsequent to receiving this message, Members
can begin to send transactions to GSD to be included in that day’s processing. Any
messages received by GSD after this point, and before the end-of-day submission cutoff, will
result in immediate acknowledgement/rejection. GSD will also, at this point, begin sending
acknowledgement/rejection MT509 output for all trades received after the prior business
day’s cutoff point, or
• /SCDM/ – this qualifier indicates that this MT599 message is GSD’s notification to the
Member that they may no longer submit transactions for demand comparison for that
business day. Any transactions submitted to GSD after this point will be submitted for
bilateral comparison, or
• /SCDK/ – this qualifier indicates that this MT599 message is GSD’s notification to the
Member that they may no longer submit DK notices on demand trades submitted against
them by a counterparty for that business day, or

(following the qualifier ‘/NXTD/’), or
• /EODC/ – this qualifier indicates that this MT599 message is GSD’s notification to
• Members that GSD has completed its batch processes and no more interactive comparison
output will be generated for GSD for that business day. Any comparison related output sent
by GSD after this point (through the generation of the next ‘EODC’ message) will be for the
business day indicated below (following the qualifier ‘/NXTD/’), or
• /SNET/ – this qualifier indicates that this MT599 message is the GCF system’s notification to
Members that the current day’s net has begun, and as applicable

Appendix B – Message Flows
This appendix of Message Flows contains detailed diagrams depicting the flows of messages to and from GSD
f or a various transaction related scenarios. As this document is meant to provide message specification details
relating to the support of GSD’s comparison system processing, the flows reflected in this Appendix B will
include various trade input and trade status messaging flows only.
The f ollowing should be noted:
1. All f lows have been ordered based on whether the flow is applicable to the Bilateral Comparison process,
or whether the f low depicts messaging for Demand or Locked-in Trades.
2. Rather than using the terminology “Participant A” and “Participant B,” GSD has amended all flows to
ref lect “Member A” and “Member B”. Where the flows depict scenarios for Locked-in or Demand Trades,
Member A will always be the Demand or Locked-in Submitter. Member B will always be the Demand or
Locked-in Recipient.
3. All Demand and Locked-in flows assume Bilateral Comparison, unless “Administrative Comparison” has
been indicated.
4. These f lows are based on those messages that would be generated from the Comparison system only.
These f lows will not include those messages that would be generated from the Netting system (netting
and/or settlement messages). You may ref er to the most current “GSD Interactive Messaging (IM)
Member Specifications for Netting Output” document for flows that will contain comparison, netting and/or
settlement related messages.

Appendix F – Detailed Field Analysis Results – Comparison Messages
This appendix on Detailed Field Analysis Results - Comparison Messages is intended to provide development
personnel with the ‘tools’ to code for GSD’s current outbound messaging and for future releases without
causing a disruption to Member service.
GSD is, to the extent possible, committed to adhering to the guidelines presented in this document. As new
services are offered by GSD which can be supported by Interactive Messaging, messages representing new
events may be identified that do not fit into the categories presented in this matrix. In this event, GSD will notify
Members with sufficient advance notice for programming support.
Assumptions
• Analysis was performed in order to minimize Member programming for subsequent phases, and to help
ensure that any changes implemented by GSD in the future can be done so using one production version
of the application, without requiring ‘big bang’ changes by Members.
• MT515 Inbound Messages and MT599 Administrative Messages are not included in the analysis.
• Analysis was performed on all messages generated to date including changes made in support of the
GSD’s Same-Day Settling Service.
• No changes have been made to qualifiers for any messages already in production.
• If new events are recognized, new messages may need to be processed by all Members.
Approach
Seven major categories of comparison-related events on system were identified:
1. Record Accepted
2. Record Rejected
3. Record Processed
4. Events sourced in the GSD system (not submitted by Members through a machine-to-machine interface)
5. Advisories/Requests for Action
6. Removal of Advisories
7. Contra Modifies
All record types were then sorted by the above categories, and then further sorted by whether they were
related to the following instruction type:
• Instruct
• Modify
• Cancel
• DK
Within each category we also identified whether the message
• was already in production,
• would be implemented in the next release of the Interactive Messaging software, or
• was not yet identified (Future Messages).
